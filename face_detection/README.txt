create a folder
then, copy/download the "/faces"(folder) and "facereg.py"(python program) in that folder.
then, run the "facereg.py" - you will get faces in the photo as face1,face2,... in "/faces" folder.

  if you want ti try a new photo,
  copy the photo to the "/faces" folder.
  and open the program

    the directroy is the directory where you saved your photo
    in our senario the directory will be "faces/<your file name>.<photo format>"
